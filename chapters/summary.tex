The Higgs boson is a key element of the Standard Model,
our current best understanding of Nature, and a rich experimental
programme is currently underway to measure its properties
and interactions with other fundamental particles. Any
discrepancy between the experimental data and predictions
from the Standard Model could point the way towards new
physics, potentially addressing the acute theoretical
and experimental problems of the Standard Model.

The experimental programme relies on the ability to
accelerate protons to very high energies using the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN, and collide them at the centre of
general purpose detectors, ATLAS, and CMS. The work presented
in this thesis relies on the data collected by the ATLAS
detector and focuses on the search for the decay of the
Higgs boson to muon pairs.

Muons are reconstructed in ATLAS by using information
from the inner tracker, muon spectrometer, and the
calorimeter system. Muon momentum is measured to the
precision of a few percent at the scales relevant for
the search, and is calibrated in MC simulation by using
the invariant mass peak of the $Z$ boson as a standard
candle. Muon isolation, important for distinguishing
between real prompt muons and fake muons or muons from
secondary vertices, is described using information from
both the tracker and the calorimeters. The isolation
efficiency in MC simulation is corrected by the scale
factors, measured using the tag-and-probe method. A
novel method of background subtraction reduces the
systematic uncertainties associated with the
scale factors by up to 75\% in the low transverse
momentum regime. A machine learning approach to
estimating and eventually improving muon resolution
with the goal of improving analysis sensitivity is
presented but the observed improvements are too small
to justify the additional complexity of the analysis.
