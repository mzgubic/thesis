\newpage
The ATLAS detector, described in the previous chapter, is a monument
to the engineers and physicists who designed and built it. However,
in order to turn its raw output of nearly one hundred million readout
channels per event to physics knowledge, it requires an intermediate step:
the reconstruction of physics objects.

Muons, the central physics object in this thesis, are reconstructed
by combining the information from the tracker and the muon spectrometer.
In order to be able to do precision studies the Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation of the detector response needs to be calibrated to match
the response in the real detector. In particular, the transverse momentum of
muons needs to be calibrated to the resolution obtained in the real
detector. Similarly, the reconstruction, track-to-vertex-association (TTVA),
and isolation efficiencies need to be calibrated to match those in 
recorded data. These calibrations are obtained through measurements
and carry associated uncertainties.

This chapter describes the first novel contributions from the author.
The first is an improved method of background subtraction in the isolation
efficiency measurements, which significantly reduces the systematic
uncertainty for muons with $\pt < 15$ \GeV. The second is an attempt
to improve muon momentum resolution.

\section{Reconstruction}

Tracks in the inner detector (ID) are reconstructed indiscriminately for
all charged particles. First, raw data from the detectors is converted
into space-points which form the basis of tracking. The main track finding
algorithm proceeds inside-out by finding the seeds in the silicon layers.
The seeds are then combined into roads and the extension to the TRT layer
is probed to add hits in the outermost layer. The final collection of hits
is fit to obtain the track parameters \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2010-072, Cornelissen:1020106}.
Tracks with at least $\pt > 400$ \MeV~and some other requirements, found
in Ref. \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-026} are then used to find the primary
vertices. The reconstruction of primary vertices proceeds by first finding
the vertices and then fitting them \cite{Aaboud:2016rmg}. Finally, tracks
are associated with vertices which allows the computation of $d_0$, the
transverse impact parameter, which quantifies the shortest distance
between the track and the beam-line, and $z_0$, the longitudinal impact
parameter, which quantifies the difference between the $z$ coordinate
of the associated primary vertex, and the $z$ coordinate of the point
where $d_0$ is computed.

The reconstruction of tracks in the muon spectrometer (MS) proceeds by
first finding track segments in the MDT chambers using a Hough transform
\cite{ILLINGWORTH198887}, and then reconstructing them by fitting a
straight line to the associated hits. The segments are combined to
form MS tracks starting from the middle layer and finding compatible
segments in the inner and outer layers of the spectrometer. At least two
segments are needed to form a track, apart from the transition region
in which a single high quality segment can be used to build a track.
Finally, a global $\chi^2$ fit of the track is performed and the track
accepted if it satisfies the quality criteria. Otherwise, hits with 
high contribution to the $\chi^2$ value are removed and the track refit.
Hits can also be added to the track if they are consistent with the
track and the track is refit if these candidates are found \cite{Aad:2016jkr}.
