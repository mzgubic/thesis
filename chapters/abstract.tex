\chapter*{Abstract}
This Report presents the information required for the Confirmation of DPhil Status.
Scientific context of the thesis is presented first in the draft of the thesis
introduction chapter. The authorâ€™s original contributions to date are then laid
out and followed by an outline of the thesis. The next section presents the draft
of the main chapter of the thesis, a search for the Higgs boson decay to a muon
pair with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using 79.8 $\ifb$ of data at the centre-of-mass
energy of $\sqrts = 13~\TeV$. Muon performance studies, along with the reanalysis including
the 2018 dataset are expected to complete the thesis.
