It is an immense privilege to be born in a society with means and resolve
to generously support education and science. Specifically, I have benefitted
from superb education provided by II. gimnazija Maribor, Imperial College
London, and University of Oxford, supported by the Slovenian and British
public. Similarly, the scientific content of this thesis critically depends
on the work of my ATLAS collaborators and colleagues at CERN operating the
LHC, all supported by the human populace around the world.

I am indebted in particular to individuals who devote their time and energy
to pass their knowledge to others, and do so with inspiration and enthusiasm.
Specifically, I would like to thank Barbara Pe\'canac, Zdenka Keuc, and Gorazd
\v{Z}iberna for their classes that have inspired countless students to pursue
higher education in science. I am grateful to Adam Dobbs and Jordan Nash for
directing my interest to particle physics, and to Gavin Davies, Patrick Dunne,
and Bj\"{o}rn Penning for their patience and perseverance in directing my
first research efforts in high energy physics. 

This thesis would not have been completed without the mentorship and guidance
of Ian Shipsey and Giacomo Artoni. I thank Ian for his enduring faith in my
abilities and encouragement to tackle challenges that seemed insurmountable.
He taught me that it is better to set the goals high and never reach them,
than to set them too low and achieve them.
I thank Giacomo for 


They have been the kindest and most
supportive mentors anyone could wish for.

Giacomo's scientific ingenuity is
only matched by his intangible ability to promote a welcoming and inclusive
environment, setting the high standard we should all strive for. He taught me
that everyone has something to contribute and the importance of discovering 
and nurturing it.

I thank Max Bellomo, Stefano Rosati, and Federico Sforza for welcoming me to the MCP
group, and Giacomo Artoni, Jan Kretzschmar, Haifeng Li, and Stefano Rosati
for their leadership of the $\hmumu$ analysis team. In addition, I thank the $\hmumu$
analysis contributors for their simultaneously creative and scientifically rigorous work,
for their relentless drive to push the sensitivity of the available dataset to its absolute limits,
and for the countless entertaining meetings.

Discussions with Luca Ambroz, Lydia Beresford, Mikkel Bj{\o}rn, Maria Giovanna Foti,
Tereza Kroupov\'a, Jesse Liu, Luigi Marchese,
Nurfikri Norjoharuddeen, Santiago Paredes, Mariyan Petrov, Wouter Van de Pontseele,
Hannah Pullen, Elisabeth Schopf, Beojan Stanislaus, Cecilia Tosciri,
Iza Veli\v{s}\v{c}ek, Yingjie Wei, Ricardo W\"olker, Philipp Windischhofer,
and Siyuan Yan made me a better physicist
and a happier person. I am also thankful to Pio Monti for his wise
words on statistics and machine learning, and to Vip Davda, Pete Gronbech, and
Kashif Mohammad for their help with computing.

I want to thank Daniela Bortoletto and Ian Shipsey for fostering an energetic
and inclusive particle physics group, as well as Jennifer Matthews, Kim Proudfoot,
and Sue Geddes for their hard work that enables us to do the best science we can.
In particular I am grateful to Sue Geddes for her invaluable help with the
organisation of the MLHEP summer school and the ML+Physics seminar series,
as well as for her amicable presence from the very first day at the department. I
also want to thank Peter Braam for his kind invitation to help with the
ML+Physics seminar series.
