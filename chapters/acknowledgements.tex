\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I am grateful for the mentorship and guidance of Ian Shipsey and Giacomo Artoni
on all aspects of my DPhil journey. They have been the kindest and most
supportive mentors anyone could wish for. While Ian's passion for
scientific endeavor continues to inspire generations of Oxford physicists,
it is his courage to tackle grand challenges that I look up to the most. He
taught me that it is better to set the goals too high and never reach them, than to
set them too low and achieve them. Giacomo's scientific ingenuity is
only matched by his intangible ability to promote a welcoming and inclusive
environment, setting the high standard we should all strive for. He taught me
that everyone has something to contribute and the importance of discovering 
and nurturing it.

I thank Max Bellomo, Stefano Rosati, and Federico Sforza for welcoming me to the MCP
group, and Giacomo Artoni, Jan Kretzschmar, Haifeng Li, and Stefano Rosati
for their leadership of the $\hmumu$ analysis team. In addition, I thank the $\hmumu$
analysis contributors for their simultaneously creative and scientifically rigorous work,
for their relentless drive to push the sensitivity of the available dataset to its absolute limits,
and for the countless entertaining meetings.

Discussions with Luca Ambroz, Lydia Beresford, Mikkel Bj{\o}rn, Maria Giovanna Foti,
Tereza Kroupov\'a, Jesse Liu, Luigi Marchese,
Nurfikri Norjoharuddeen, Santiago Paredes, Mariyan Petrov, Wouter Van de Pontseele,
Hannah Pullen, Elisabeth Schopf, Beojan Stanislaus, Cecilia Tosciri,
Iza Veli\v{s}\v{c}ek, Yingjie Wei, Ricardo W\"olker, Philipp Windischhofer,
and Siyuan Yan made me a better physicist
and a happier person. I am also thankful to Pio Monti for his wise
words on statistics and machine learning, and to Vip Davda, Pete Gronbech, and
Kashif Mohammad for their help with computing.

I want to thank Daniela Bortoletto and Ian Shipsey for fostering an energetic
and inclusive particle physics group, as well as Jennifer Matthews, Kim Proudfoot,
and Sue Geddes for their hard work that enables us to do the best science we can.
In particular I am grateful to Sue Geddes for her invaluable help with the
organisation of the MLHEP summer school and the ML+Physics seminar series,
as well as for her amicable presence from the very first day at the department. I
also want to thank Peter Braam for his kind invitation to help with the
ML+Physics seminar series.

This research would not have been possible without my ATLAS collaborators
and colleagues at CERN operating the LHC. It was supported by the UK Science and
Technology Facilities Council.
