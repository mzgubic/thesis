\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I am grateful for the mentorship and guidance of Ian Shipsey and Giacomo Artoni
on all aspects of my DPhil journey and beyond. I thank Giacomo Artoni, Max Bellomo,
Jan Kretzschmar, Haifeng Li, Stefano Rosati, and Federico Sforza for their leadership
of the $\hmumu$ analysis team and the Muon Combined Performance group.

Discussions with Luca Ambroz, Mikkel Bj{\o}rn, Maria Giovanna Foti, Jesse Liu, Luigi Marchese,
Nurfikri Norjoharuddeen, Santiago Paredes, Mariyan Petrov, Wouter Van de Pontseele,
Cecilia Tosciri, Ricardo W\"olker, and Philipp Windischhofer made me a better physicist
and a happier person. I am also thankful to Pio Monti for his wise words on statistics
and machine learning, and to Pete Gronbech, Vipul Davda, and Kashif Mohammad for their
help with computing. This research would not have been possible without my ATLAS collaborators
and colleagues at CERN operating the LHC. It was supported by the UK Science and
Technology Facilities Council.
