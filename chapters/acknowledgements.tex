\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I am grateful for the mentorship and guidance of Ian Shipsey and Giacomo Artoni
on all aspects of my DPhil journey. They have been the kindest and most
supportive mentors anyone could have wished for. Ian's passion for
scientific endeavor continues to inspire generations of Oxford physicists, but
it will be his courage to tackle grand challenges that I look up to the most. He
taught me to set the goals high enough to never reach them and in the process
surpass the more modest original ambitions. Giacomo's scientific ingenuity is
only matched by his intangible ability to promote a welcoming and energetic
environment, setting the unreacheable standard we should all strive for.

I thank Max Bellomo, Stefano Rosati, and Federico Sforza for welcoming me to the MCP
group, and Giacomo Artoni, Jan Kretzschmar, Haifeng Li, and Stefano Rosati
for their leadership of the $\hmumu$ analysis team.

Discussions with Luca Ambroz, Lydia Beresford, Mikkel Bj{\o}rn, Maria Giovanna Foti,
Tereza Kroupov\'a, Jesse Liu, Luigi Marchese,
Nurfikri Norjoharuddeen, Santiago Paredes, Mariyan Petrov, Wouter Van de Pontseele,
Hannah Pullen, Elisabeth Schopf, Beojan Stanislaus, Cecilia Tosciri,
Iza Veli\v{s}\v{c}ek, Yingjie Wei, Ricardo W\"olker, Philipp Windischhofer,
and Siyuan Yan made me a better physicist
and a happier person. I am also thankful to Vid Kocijan and Pio Monti for their wise
words on statistics and machine learning, and to Vip Davda, Pete Gronbech, and
Kashif Mohammad for their help with computing.

I want to thank Daniela Bortoletto and Ian Shipsey for fostering an inclusive
and welcoming particle physics group, as well as Jennifer Matthews, Kim Proudfoot,
and Sue Geddes for their hard work that enables us to do the best science we can.
In particular I am grateful to Sue Geddes for her invaluable help with the
organisation of the MLHEP summer school and the ML+Physics seminar series,
but most of all for her amicable presence. I also want to thank Peter Braam for his kind
invitation to help with the ML+Physics seminar series.

This research would not have been possible without my ATLAS collaborators
and colleagues at CERN operating the LHC. It was supported by the UK Science and
Technology Facilities Council.
